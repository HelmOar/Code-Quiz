# CODE QUIZ

## Description

Code Quiz is an application that functions as a coding assessment which could be used as part of an interview process to assess a Web Developer's knowledge. 

The quiz is a timed challenge with multiple-choice style questions. The user is able to view their result as they progress through each question and then finally is able to save their score on the final page. 

The app runs on the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML, and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The interface is clean, polished and responsive. 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## How to Contribute

# CODE QUIZ

## Description

Code Quiz is an application that functions as a coding assessment which could be used as part of an interview process to assess a Web Developer's knowledge. 

The quiz is a timed challenge with multiple-choice style questions. The user is able to view their result as they progress through each question and then finally is able to save their score on the final page. 

The app runs on the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML, and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The interface is clean, polished and responsive. The various parts of the quiz hide and appear as necessary. The user's score is acculumated and the stored in local storage where it is recalled in order to appear on the High Score final page.

The quiz uses JavaScript methods to move between the hidden and unhidden element - these are powered by eventlisteners. The quiz question data is stored in an array in it's own file where it is passed through an if loop before it is rendered on the page.

The timer counts down the quiz time and also subtracts 10 seconds for each wrongly answered question. This makes for a challenging but not impossible game. 


## Usage

The application can be used as a teaching method or as part of a possible interview process.
